# Neural-Network---Poker-Hand-Classification

Implementation of neural network for solving poker classification problem.
Implementation is heavily influenced by Deep Learning course on Coursera.
Used data set can be found on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand

Implementation is still far from perfect as it lacks regularization and with given set of hyperparameters it still fails to rank poker hands well.
